Every two weeks at Code Factory we had Code Review which we had to make with no help from teachers. 
We reviewed the knowledges, which we gained during two weeks. Although all skills were trained during two weeks,
there was one challenge, which we had to try to handle. 
For this Code Review I have goor 100 out of 100 points.
